# Auto-Translate
A tool to automate the translation process
## Planned Flow
1. Extract new translation keys using the simple-localize cli (or code adapted from it)
2. Ask the user to provide context & translation in one language
3. Use chatGPT to generate the remaining translations
4. Post to Slack
5. Create keys on simple-localize with the initial translations
